# Miniproject: ros-orf
## Introduction
**First miniproject in my journey of teaching myself bioinformatics.**

This miniproject will take me through Python, R, Bash and Git.
It is rooted in Rosalind problem [ORF](https://rosalind.info/problems/orf/), expanded into incremental levels of complexity - each level setting new goals and introducing new skills.

*Project is ongoing!*


> [!NOTE]
> Rosalind problem [ORF](https://rosalind.info/problems/orf/):
> 
> Return list of all peptides potentially encoded in a given DNA sequence, through analysis of start and stop codon positions of putative open reading frames (ORFs).


| Level | Task | Main learning goals |
| ----- | ---- | -------------- |
| Level 1 | Solve Rosalind problem ORF | Python loops, dictionaries, lists... Parsing FASTA files. Dealing with reading frames. Biopython. |
| Level 2 | Gather and analyse data, and generate FASTA files | Pandas dataframes. Plotting with ggplot2. Writing FASTA files. |
| Level 3 | Improve usability and performance | Organizing files into packaged modules or scripts, running Python scripts through Bash. Plotting with python. |

It will be my first time using Git and GitHub - if things get messy, that's why.
